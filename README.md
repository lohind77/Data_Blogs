# Data_Blogs
A project folder for visualization containing all the data files, scripts or code, images, charts or graphs, and documentation related to the visualization.

### About Blogs:
I decided to write these blog because when I first started doing data analysis and visualization, I found it challenging to do simple lab experiments because I was inexperienced with the tools and libraries needed for data visualisation. To help other beginners with their learning, I decided to create some blogs using a dataset from my lab experiment with help of my friend Akhil Amireddy (Collaborator).
