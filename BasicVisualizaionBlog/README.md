In this blog, I will demonstrate how to use Python and its libraries for data analysis, cleaning, and visualisation using a dataset given in my lab experiment. I provide simple explanations and examples to assist fellow beginners grasp these concepts quickly. I hope that by sharing my own learning experience and ideas, might help in making data visualisation more accessible to people who are just getting started in data science.

### About dataset:

#### Dataset is taken from the Kaggle.

#### The dataset includes information on immigration to Canada from all across the world between 1981 and 2013. It has multiple columns providing details on different areas of immigration. A list of the columns in the dataset is provided below:

Type: It categorizes the people into "Non-immigrants" or "immigrants". 

Country Name: This column holds the names of the countries from which the immigrants originated.

Country Code: The country code column represents a code or identifier associated with geographic location of the country.

Continent Name: This column contains name of the continents corresponding to country code.

Other columns: The dataset may contain additional columns representing various variables related to immigration such as numerical values of count of immigrants from year 1981 to 2013, demographic information, visa categories, or other relevant data points.

#### The dataset allows for analyzing and exploring patterns and trends in immigration to Canada over time, considering different countries of origin and relevant demographic variables. By performing data visualization and analysis, one can gain insights into the immigration patterns and understand the changing dynamics of immigration over the specified time period.
